After the Chiefs, the 49ers sit at +700. 

San Francisco's Super Bowl odds moved slightly from +800 after defeating the Seahawks 36-24.

"[The 49ers] have a higher standard than almost everybody in the league, not named the Kansas City Chiefs," host Colin Cowherd said on "The Herd" after the Niners' Thursday Night Football win over Seattle. "You can feel that pressure weekly.

"But unlike the Chiefs … they're the only ones that don't have a trophy."

Tied with S.F. at +700 is Baltimore.

"Baltimore finally got a star running back who's healthy, really nice receivers, Mark Andrews at tight end, and this is what it looks like," Cowherd explained on a recent episode.

The next team on the board is Detroit. The Lions moved to +850 from +1000 after their Week 6 win over the Cowboys.

"They did whatever they wanted to do in the passing game … in the running game. They sent a message," former NFL Pro Bowl quarterback and contributor Matt Hasselbeck said on "The Herd" after Detroit's 47-9 win over Dallas.

The Packers are another team whose Super Bowl odds are on the move. 

Green Bay moved to +1800 from +2500 after its decisive 34-13 win over Arizona.
