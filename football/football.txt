And in addition to the Beck-Ewers tie, Travis Hunter is closing in.

Even though Beck and his Dawgs bounced back in Week 6 with a 31-13 win over Auburn, the Georgia signal caller's draft odds took a bit of a tumble, putting him in a dead heat with the Longhorns' Ewers.

Ewers has been sidelined since Texas faced UTSA in Week 3 with an abdominal injury, but it has been reported that he will return to action as UT faces Oklahoma in Week 7.

A player whose odds have surged up the board is Colorado's Travis Hunter.

He rounds out the top three at +750, moving from +1800 over the last week.

And according to FOX Sports NFL Draft analyst Rob Rang, his unique talent as both a wide receiver and cornerback increases his draft stock.

"Well into my third decade of professionally evaluating college prospects for pro football, I can honestly say that I’ve never seen a player quite like Colorado’s do-everything dynamo and Heisman Trophy contender, Travis Hunter," Rang wrote.

"If Hunter were to focus on just one of the positions he plays, he is talented enough to warrant a top-10 draft selection. If teams feel that he is able to play both positions in the NFL as dominantly as he has for Colorado, he just might be the No. 1 overall selection — which is exactly where I placed him in my early mock draft."

Fourth on the board is Hunter's teammate and Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders, who's moved to +900 from +1100 over the last two weeks. 

At the end of April, Sanders opened as the favorite in this spot.
